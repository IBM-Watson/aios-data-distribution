    "\n",
    "Please provide information about the training data which is used to train the model.  In order to explain the configuration better, let us first consider an example of a Loan Processing Model which is trying to predict whether a person should get a loan or not. The training data for such a model will potentially contain the following columns: Credit_History, Monthly_salary, Applicant_Age, Loan_amount, Gender, Marital_status, Approval.  The \"Approval\" column contains the target field (label column or class label) and it can have the following values: \"Loan Granted\", \"Loan Denied\" or \"Loan Partially Granted\".  In this model we would like to ensure that the model is not biased against Gender=Female or Gender=Transgender.  We would also like to ensure that the model is not biased against the age group 15 to 30 years or age group 61 to 120 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the above model, the configuration information that we need to provide is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- class_label:  This is the name of the column in the training data dataframe (data_df) which contains the target field (also known as label column or the class label).  For the Loan Processing Model it would be \"Approval\".\n",
    "- feature_columns: This is a comma separated list of column names which contain the feature column names (in the training data dataframe data_df).  For the Loan Processing model this would be: [\"Credit_History\", \"Monthly_salary\", \"Applicant_Age\", \"Loan_amount\", \"Gender\", \"Marital_status\"]\n",
    "- categorical_columns: The list of column names (in data_df) which contain categorical values.  This should also include those columns which originally contained categorical values and have now been converted to numeric values. E.g., in the Loan Processing Model, the Marital_status column originally could have values: Single, Married, Divorced, Separated, Widowed.  These could have been converted to numeric values as follows: Single -> 0, Married -> 1, Divorced -> 2, Separated -> 3 and Widowed -> 4.  Thus the training data will have numeric values.  Please identify such columns as categorical.  Thus the list of categorical columns for the Loan Processing Model will be Credit_History, Gender and Marital_status. \n",

For the Loan Processing Model, let us say that the Bank is willing to tolerate the fact that Female and Transgender applicants will get upto 20% lesser approved loans than Males.  However, if the percentage is more than 20% then the Loan Processing Model will be considered biased.  E.g., if the percentage of approved loans for Female or Transgender applicants is say 25% lesser than those approved for Male applicants then the Model is to be considered as acting in a biased manner.
